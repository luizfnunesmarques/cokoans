# CoKoans [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/luizfnunesmarques/cokoans.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/luizfnunesmarques/cokoans)

Try a new language without needing to setup dependencies. No more dependencies headache or waste time with internet connection.
- Languages:
  - Ruby

## Pre dependencies (run on a terminal)
- A Docker setup working:
 `docker -v `
- Clone this repository:
 `https://github.com/luizfnunesmarques/cokoans`

## Playing with your language :rocket:
  - run your language script, e.g., if you want to try Ruby:
  `./ruby-koans`
- Watch the results: did your challenge pass? If yes, just go through to the next indicated challenge, and run the script again :tada:
- The files you edit on your machine are always reflected in the running container.

## Common issues
  * Permission denied when running the script:
    * Give it to it :rocket:
      * `chmod +x ruby-koans`
